# Spacing

Minds components follow a 16px spacing system. By following a predefined spatial convention, we decrease design complexity while increasing consistency across the application.

## Progression
Spacing currently progresses in a linear fashion, increasing/decreasing by a factor of 0.25. This is appropraite for the smaller spaces, however it may be worth considering increasing this factor as spacing increases, perhaps to a factor of 0.5 per increment over 16px. See proposal within the Figma embed below.
