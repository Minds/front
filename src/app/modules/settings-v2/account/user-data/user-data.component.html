    <p>
      Your user data consists of two primary categories of data:
    </p>

    <p>
      (1) A record of your public contributions to the network, including your
      public profile, posts, media uploads, and votes. These are stored
      indefinitely (or until you remove them) so that they are available to you
      and other public users of the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      (2) Observational analytics, including which pages and posts you've seen,
      which buttons you've clicked on, and contextual information like which
      browser you're using, and where you came from. Observational analytics are
      used internally and allow us to reduce spam, diagnose problems with the
      app, and understand how to improve the service. They also allow us to
      enhance your experience, e.g. by recommending only posts that you haven't
      already seen before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Observational analytics are not shared with outside companies for tracking
      purposes. Moreover, we offer you the transparency to download your
      personal analytics to see what's collected, and optionally opt-out of
      collection if you prefer.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      <span>Note:</span>
      By opting out of observational analytics, you may see recommendations for
      posts you've already seen. And because observational analytics allow us to
      detect spam engagements, opting out means that your app engagements will
      not contribute to trending rankings and engagement rewards.
