      To ensure that decisions are made as democratically as possible, we
      developed a Jury System based on the
      <a href="https://santaclaraprinciples.org/" target="_blank"
        >Santa Clara Principles</a
      >
      to review appeals. A Jury consists of 12 randomly selected unique active
      Minds users who are not subscribed to the user under review. Each juror
      selected is provided with the option to participate, pass or opt-out of
      the Jury pool entirely. If 75% or more of the Jury members vote to accept
      the appeal of a strike, the administrative action is overturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If less than 75% of the Jury members vote accept the appeal, the
      administrative action is upheld. The decision of the Jury will be final.

    <p>The current content moderation system functions as follows:</p>

    <img
      src="{{ cdnAssetsUrl }}assets/screenshots/flow.png"
      style="max-width: 90%;"
    />

    <h4>Strike Offense</h4>
    <p>
      Users will receive a strike for certain violations of the Content Policy.
      Users will be notified about the strike, which term was violated, and
      which piece of content was in violation. All strikes can be appealed to a
      Minds Jury. Individual strikes will expire after 90 days.
    </p>

    <p>The following violations will result in a strike:</p>
    <p>
      Untagged NSFW Post (three strikes required for each individual NSFW
      category)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strike 1 = Warning</li>
      <li>Strike 2 = 2nd Warning</li>
      <li>Strike 3 = Full channel marked with NSFW category</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Harassment and Spam</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strike 1 = Warning</li>
      <li>Strike 2 = 2nd Warning</li>
      <li>Strike 3 = Ban</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      NSFW (not safe for work) is defined as content containing nudity,
      pornography, profanity, violence, gore, or sensitive commentary on race,
      religion, or gender. In general terms, it is defined as content which a
      reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing, in a public setting,
      such as in a workplace. These tags can be applied to individual content or
      any group or channel. The full channel will not be marked with a NSFW
      category until it has received 3 strikes in a single NSFW category.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spam on Minds is generally defined as repeated, unwanted, and/or
      unsolicited actions, automated or manual, that negatively affect Minds
      users, groups, and/or Minds itself. Spam also includes content that is
      designed to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients
      as to the source of the material (such as spoofing). Spam may result in an
      immediate ban if determined to be malicious or by use of a bot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spam may result in an immediate ban if determined to be malicious or by
      use of a bot.
    </p>

    <h4>Immediate Ban Offense</h4>

    <p>
      Users will be immediately banned for certain violations of the Content
      Policy. Users will be notified about the ban and which term was violated,
      but they will not be able to see the content that was in violation as it
      will have to be removed from Minds. Appeals on immediate bans will be
      reviewed by the Minds admins and not a jury due to the nature of the
      content.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Illegal (terrorism, paedophilia, extortion, fraud, revenge porn, sex
        trafficking)
      </li>
      <li>Personal and confidential information (doxxing)</li>
      <li>Malware</li>
      <li>Token manipulation</li>
      <li>Impersonation</li>
      <li>Incites a true threat of violence</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Boost Policy</h4>
    <p>
      Boost is the advertising network on Minds. Users may exchange Minds Tokens
      to “Boost” their content and receive views from the network. Users may not
      Boost any content that is in violation of our Content Policy.
      Additionally, users may not Boost content that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Appeals on a moderation decision</li>
      <li>Exceeds Boost rate limits;</li>
      <li>Is a Help & Support request;</li>
      <li>Is selling Minds Tokens;</li>
      <li>Contains content from a banned user</li>
      <li>Onchain payment failed</li>
      <li>Original post has been removed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you would like to appeal a Boost rejection, you may do so by emailing
      info@minds.com with the post in question and the reasons for why you
      believe it should be accepted.
