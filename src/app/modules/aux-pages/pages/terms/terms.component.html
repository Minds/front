<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>The gist</h2>
<p>
  We (the people who work with Minds) create free and open source software and
  run the Minds.com social network. We would love for you to use it and help us
  evolve this document in the direction that best supports and protects Minds
  and its community. Public commentary and peer-review is encouraged on
  <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/minds">Gitlab</a>. The Minds basic
  service of creating a channel or launching a presence on
  <a routerLink="/">Minds.com</a> is free. We also offer paid upgrades for
  advanced features and other commercial services.
</p>
<p>
  Minds software and services are designed to give you as much control and
  ownership over your social experience as possible and to encourage you to
  express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you publish and use
  basic Internet safety procedures when posting. In particular, make sure that
  none of the prohibited items listed in the
  <a routerLink="/content-policy">Minds Content Policy</a>, as defined in
  Section 15, appear on your channel or get linked to/from your channel (things
  like spam, malware, viruses, or illegal content or serious threats of
  violence.)
</p>
<p>
  If you find content that is objectionable, then Unsubscribe, Block, Report or
  just swipe on by. Minds is an open, free and public commons where users
  respect the right to use free speech. Of course, you may find a violation of
  these Terms of Service as you traverse Minds, in which case please Report the
  channel from the Settings cog on the content or channel profile or by email to
  <a href="mailto:info@minds.com">info@minds.com</a>.

<h2>7. Reporting Copyright Infringement, DMCA Policy and Other Violations</h2>

<p>
  1. We may update our Services from time to time, but they will not necessarily

<h2>25. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration; Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
  1. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO
  ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH MINDS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN
  WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
</p>
<p>
  a. <b>Binding Arbitration</b>. Except for any disputes, claims, suits,
  actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”)
  in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the
  alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation,
  copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and
  Minds (i) waive your and Minds’ respective rights to have any and all Disputes
  arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive
  your and Minds’ respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Minds will
  arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
  Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted
  by applicable law. (This includes the referral of a Dispute to one or more
  persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding
  determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge
  or jury in court).
</p>
<p>
  b. <b>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</b>. Any
  Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Minds
  and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be
  brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
  representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration
  in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of
  another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be
  brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or
  outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  c. <b>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</b>. Each Party will notify the
  other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the
  date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the
  Dispute informally. Notice to Minds shall be sent by email to Minds at
  <a href="mailto:info@minds.com">info@minds.com</a>. Notice to you shall be by
  email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must
  include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number,
  (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute,
  and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Minds cannot
  agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after the
  date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Minds may,
  as appropriate and in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration
  proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in these Terms, file a
  claim in court.
</p>
<p>
  d. <b>Process</b>. Any arbitration will occur in the State of Connecticut.
  Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in
  accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services
  (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal
  courts located in the State of Connecticut will have exclusive jurisdiction
  over (i) any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award, or (ii) any
  claim filed in court where permitted in these Terms.
</p>
<p>
  e. <b>Authority of Arbitrator.</b> As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the
  applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority
  and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a
  Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and
  (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in
  court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to
  conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by
  these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may
  not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of
  class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving
  more than one individual.
</p>
<p>
  f. <b>Rules of JAMS.</b> The rules of JAMS and additional information about
  JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these
  Terms, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand
  the rules of JAMS, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS
  and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any
  reason.
</p>
<p>
  g. <b>Injunctions and Court Proceedings.</b> With respect to any action or
  proceeding for which courts are an expressly permitted method of adjudication
  hereunder (set forth below), the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all such
  actions or proceedings arising out of, or related to, these Terms will be in
  an appropriate state or federal court located in the State of Connecticut.
  (the “Designated Courts”), and the Parties hereby irrevocably consent to the
  personal and subject matter jurisdiction of such court, waive any claim that
  such courts do not constitute a convenient and appropriate venue for such
  actions or proceedings, and waive the right to a trial by jury. Each Party
  consents to service of process upon itself by means of any of the methods for
  delivery of notice that are specified in these Terms.
</p>
<p>
  h. To the extent that arbitration pursuant to the terms of this section is not
  permitted under applicable law, a Party may seek resolution of any dispute in
  the Designated Courts.
</p>
<p>
  i. To the extent the Parties mutually-agree to forego arbitration for a
  dispute, the Parties shall seek resolution of such dispute in the Designated
  Courts.
</p>
<p>
  j. Permitted appeals and/or enforcement of an arbitration award shall take
  place in the Designated Courts.
</p>
<p>
  k. Certain breaches of these Terms by a User may, by its gravity or nature,
  cause immediate and irreparable injury to Minds that cannot be adequately
  compensated for in damages, including, without limitation, infringement of
  Minds’ intellectual property rights. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to
  the contrary in these Terms, in the event of any such breach and in addition
  to all other remedies available herein, Minds may seek solely injunctive
  relief from the Designated Courts without posting a bond or other security.
</p>
<h2>26. Governing Law</h2>
<p>
  1. These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
  with the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law
  rules or principles (whether of the State of Connecticut or any other
  jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other
  jurisdiction.
</p>
<h2>27. Waiver and Severability</h2>
<p>
  1. No waiver by Minds of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be
  deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of
  any other term or condition, and any failure of Minds to assert a right or
  provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
  provision.
</p>
<p>
  2. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
  competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason,
  such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that
  the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and
  effect.
