<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
  This privacy policy is made available for remix under a Creative Commons
  Sharealike license.
</p>
<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
  Your privacy is important to Minds, Inc. (“Minds”, “we” or “us”). It is our
  policy to respect the privacy of our users regarding all information we may
  collect while operating our Services (defined in our
  <a routerLink="/p/terms">Terms of Service</a>). This privacy policy applies to
  our Services. This privacy policy sets forth what information we collect about
  users of the Services and explains how that information is used and protected.
</p>
<p>Minds’ data privacy goals are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Classify all data for proper security, transparency and fairness</li>
  <li>Policy enforced data privacy</li>
  <li>
    Empower users to control via opt-in the use, collection and deletion of
    their Personal Information
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure users always know for what purpose their Personal Information will be
    used
  </li>
  <li>Compliance with US law</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Minds is encrypted via HTTPS, and we encrypt and/or hash all sensitive
  information while in motion or when stored at rest, including emails,
  passwords and private messages.
</p>
<p>
  Minds does not ask you for Personal Information unless it is required to
  provide certain features of the Services including, but not limited to user
  rewards, password reset, payments and two-factor authentication or Minds Token
  sales requiring AML/KYC data collection for certain purchasers.
</p>
<p>
  Minds does not willfully disclose the Personal Information of our users to
  anyone except to comply to applicable law or protect our rights.
</p>
<h2>2. Anonymity</h2>
<p>
  As a cornerstone to our privacy policy, Minds users have the right, and are
  encouraged, to be anonymous. Certain features of the Services may require you
  to submit information (including Personal Information, which is defined below)
  as a condition to use certain features of the Services. We collect your
  Personal Information when voluntarily submitted by you. The Personal
  Information you provide is used to a create user account and login credentials
  for the purpose of using certain features of the Services and/or fulfilling
  your specific requests, unless you give us permission to use it in another
  manner. We will not collect your Personal Information unless you give it to
  us. “Personal Information” means any information that is classified as
  sensitive because it is personally identifiable such as a verified name,
  fingerprints or other biometric data, email address, street address, telephone
  number or social security number. Since anonymous data is de-identified by
  definition, and registration on Minds can be anonymous, Minds classifies
  nearly all site data as public. All non-public data is either encrypted or
  hashed.
</p>
<p>
  Exceptions to the public default data classification include the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Logged-in users.</b> Data is accessible to logged-in users only</li>
  <li>
    <b>Unlisted data.</b> Data is classified as public, but it is not indexed
    and not accessible to anyone without knowledge of the URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Personal data.</b> Data that is personally identifiable such as email
    address, chat history or mobile number is classified as sensitive and
    therefore encrypted by policy when in motion or stored at rest using an
    SHA-256 unique hash ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Verified users.</b> Minds will verify users to a personal identity if a
    user requests to do so via Minds Plus. In this case Minds privacy policy is
    to accept the request for verification as consent that the non-sensitive
    data from that channel will also be handled and marked as public.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Transparency</h2>
<p>
  Internet users and content creators make a major commitment in terms of time
  and effort creating, curating and sharing. Everyone must trust their social
  media platform to be a reliable partner. Minds provides radical transparency
  in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) -</b> Minds software is free and
    open source end-to-end enabling expert inspection and peer review. Free and
    open source software enables user to “trust and verify” that Minds software
    operates as documented and advertised. Please view at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/minds"
      >https://gitlab.com/minds</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Blockchain -</b> Minds Wire and Minds Boost use Minds Tokens to record
    each transaction on the Ethereum distributed blockchain. Using peer to peer
    smart contracts and distributed, autonomous processes, Minds Tokens
    eliminate payment provider middlemen and defeat bureaus of centralized
    authority and censorship.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Public Filings -</b> In May 2017 Minds filed and completed an SEC
    Regulation CF equity crowdfunding. Minds annual report and Form C public
    filings may be found at:
    <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703996/000167025417000102/"
      >https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703996/000167025417000102/</a
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Gathering of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
  Certain visitors to Minds’ websites choose to interact with Minds in ways that
  require Minds to gather Personal Information. The amount and type of
  information that Minds gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
</p>
<p>
  For example, we may ask visitors who engage in transactions with Minds to
  provide additional information, such as necessary personal or financial
  information required to process those transactions. In each case, Minds
  collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
  fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Minds.
</p>
<p>
  Minds databases are architected to never store Personal Information in raw
  form or readable to anyone including Minds staff. Minds does not disclose
  Personal Information other than as described herein. And visitors may be
  anonymous on Minds or opt-out and refuse to supply Personal Information under
  the caveat that they understand it may prevent them from engaging in certain
  website-related activities.
</p>
<p>
  There are four categories of sensitive information that is deemed Personal
  Information which may be collected and stored by Minds:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Email address.</b> Minds stores and uses your email address to provide
    secure access to the web site. Your email address is encrypted. Minds uses
    your email to facilitate the Forgot Password function and to keep users
    updated with the network when offline. Users are not required to provide an
    email, but are warned that access to their Minds channel may be permanently
    lost and irretrievable if the user ever forgets their password. If you have
    supplied your email address, Minds may occasionally send you an email to
    tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
    date with what’s going on with Minds and our products. <br /><br />
    In all promotional emails, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of
    receiving such messages in the future by clicking on the link at the bottom
    of the email that says “unsubscribe.”
    <br /><br />
    Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we
    may send you other types of important email communications without offering
    you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them, such as administrative
    notices, or Services-related communications (e.g., account verification,
    payment confirmations, technical and security notices).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Chat history.</b> Minds messenger uses asymmetric encryption (public and
    private keys) to store the content of your messages. Messages are encrypted
    with a user's publicly available key and can only be decrypted using the
    password protected, private key belonging to the respective users. We are
    using Openssl RSA 4096 / SHA 512 password protected keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Mobile phone number.</b> Minds requests your mobile phone number as a
    requirement to participate in our daily Minds Token rewards program. We use
    the mobile number to establish a unique ID against which we may calculate
    daily rewards. This prevents others from easily and unfairly making fake
    accounts and defrauding the reward pool. Minds does not store the phone
    numbers you provide. The numbers are stored as a SHA-256 hash combined with
    a salt key. The salt ensures that the numbers can not be matched unless the
    correct salt is provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Machine dependent data.</b> Minds may require access to services on your
    mobile device such as a microphone or camera to record a video on the mobile
    application. We do not store IP addresses on Minds, and we do not use any
    such data for anything other than the stated purpose of providing utility to
    deliver the stated Minds Services.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Website Visitors</h2>
<p>
  Minds encourages anonymity and has a mission to become free from all
  dependencies on third-party, proprietary software and infrastructure. However,
  from time to time we may use one or more third-party services to improve
  certain services on our network. In order to provide you with the Services, we
  may share your Personal Information with certain authorized providers of
  third-party services (“Authorized Third Parties”) who are authorized to act on
  behalf of Minds in connection with the Services. Our agreements with any such
  Authorized Third Parties states that they will not use any Personal
  Information received from us for any purpose other than performing services on
  our behalf.
</p>
<p>
  Like most website operators, Minds also collects non-personally-identifying
  information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
  available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
  the date and time of each visitor request. Minds’ purpose in collecting
  non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Minds’
  visitors use its website. From time to time, Minds may release
  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
  report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>
<h2>6. Open Data</h2>
<p>
  Minds may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
  For instance, Minds may monitor the most popular channels, groups or activity
  on the site. Minds may display this information publicly or provide it to
  others as de-identified data. However, Minds does not disclose Personal
  Information of any kind other than as described herein.
</p>
<h2>7. Disclosure and Protection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
  Minds discloses certain potentially Personal Information only to those of its
  employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
  information in order to process it on Minds’ behalf or to provide services to
  Minds or its’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
  others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may
  be located outside of your home country; by using Minds’ websites, you consent
  to the transfer of such information to them.
</p>
<h2>8. Notification and Disclosure of Breach</h2>
<p>
  Minds will notify users immediately if we believe their Personal Information
  is disclosed in any unauthorized way.
</p>
<p>
  Although Minds provides reasonable administrative, physical and electronic
  security measures to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, we
  cannot assure the security of any information you transmit or guarantee that
  this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
</p>
<p>
  We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security,
  confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted personal Information. To the
  extent the law of your jurisdiction allows for notification of a breach via
  e-mail or public posting, you agree to accept notice in that form.
</p>
<p>
  If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
  feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
  clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
</p>
<h2>9. Cookies</h2>
<p>
  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
  computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
  visitor returns. Minds requires cookies to identify and validate sessions,
  ensure security and to improve the experience of the end users. Minds visitors
  who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
  browsers to refuse cookies before using Minds’ websites, with the drawback
  that certain features of Minds’ websites may not function properly without the
  aid of cookies.
</p>
<h2>10. How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
<p>
  Personal Information that you provide to the Services may be retained
  indefinitely, to the extent it is consistent with the Terms of Use and
  applicable law. Minds may in its discretion elect to retain Personal
  Information only while deemed necessary for business, legal and tax purposes.
</p>
<h2>11. Government, Regulatory Agencies, Courts, and Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>
  We may access, preserve, and share any information about you, without your
  consent, to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if we
  believe in good faith that it is necessary or appropriate to respond to
  requests, claims and legal process (including, but not limited to, subpoenas),
  to comply with applicable laws, to protect the property and rights of Minds,
  you or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to
  prevent or stop activity we may consider to pose a risk of being, or is,
  illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
</p>
<p>
  We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith
  belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal
  activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of audits,
  inquiries or investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
  Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for
  an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or
  obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible
  violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
</p>
<p>
  If you voluntarily share or submit any information (e.g., name) or content
  (e.g., pictures), or commentary (e.g., forums, message boards, chats) through
  the Services, or link it to any social media platforms, you acknowledge that
  the post and any content or information associated with it may become
  available to the public
</p>
<h2>12. Business Transfers</h2>
<p>
  If Minds, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
  unlikely event that Minds goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
  information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
  third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
  acquirer of Minds may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth
  in this policy. At any time users are able to delete all content and
  personally identifiable information from the site.
</p>
<h2>13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  Minds does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under
  the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services.
  The Services and their content are not directed at children under the age of
  13. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information
  from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that
  information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a
  child under 13, please contact Minds at
  <a href="mailto:info@minds.com">info@minds.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  All explicit or sensitive content exists behind multiple filters and it is
  strictly against the Terms for anyone under 18 to access such content.
</p>
<h2>14. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h2>
<p>
  Minds does not track its users over time and across third party websites to
  provide targeted advertising. Minds does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”)
  signals and handles all user information consistent with its Terms.
</p>
<h2>15. Other Web Sites and Services</h2>
<p>
  The Services may contain links to other websites or services that we do not
  own or operate. We are not responsible for the practices employed by any
  websites or services linked to or from the Services, including the information
  or content contained within them. Your browsing and interaction on any
  third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our
  Services, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies, not ours.
  In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and do not have control
  over any third-parties that you authorize to access your Personal Information.
  If you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them to access
  your Personal Information you do so at your own risk.
</p>
<h2>16. International Considerations</h2>
<p>
  We have developed data practices designed to assure all Minds information is
  appropriately protected, but we cannot always know where Personal Information
  may be accessed or processed. While our primary facilities are in the United
  States, we may transfer Personal Information or other information to
  facilities outside of the United States. In addition, we may employ other
  companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If we disclose
  Personal Information to a third party or to our employees outside of the
  United States, we will seek assurances that any information we may provide to
  them is safeguarded adequately and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
  applicable privacy laws.
</p>
<p>
  If you live in or you are visiting from the European Union or other regions
  with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing
  to the transfer of your Personal Information, including sensitive data, by us
  from your region to countries which may not have data protection laws that
  provide the same level of protection that exists in countries in the European
  Economic Area, including the United States. By providing your Personal
  Information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with
  this policy.
</p>
<h2>17. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, Minds may change its Privacy
  Policy from time to time, and in Minds’ sole discretion. Minds encourages
  visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
  If you have a Minds.com account, you should also check your account’s
  dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after
  any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
  changes.
