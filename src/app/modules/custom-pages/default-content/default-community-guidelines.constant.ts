export const DEFAULT_COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES_CONTENT = `### Community Guidelines

This community runs on Minds Networks, which enables community administrators to set and enact their own content and moderation policies. Underlying those community-specific policies is a general content policy based on the United States First Amendment and US law.


#### General content policy
The underlying general content policy prohibits spam and content that is illegal under US law.


##### Spam
Spam may take many forms, and the policy is intended to cover a range of prohibited behavior, including:

- Repeated, unwanted, and/or unsolicited actions, automated or manual, that negatively impact the community.
- Content that is designed to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing).
- Commercially-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic from the network over to another website, service, or initiative through backlinking or other inauthentic methods.
- Inauthentic engagements, that e.g., try to make channels or content appear more popular than they are.
- Coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence opinion through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, and/or scripting or automation.


##### Illegal content
Content that is illegal under US law is not permitted on the network and will result in a ban of the offending account. Illegal content categories include:

- Intellectual property violations
- Incitement to violence
- Terrorism
- Trafficking
- Revenge porn
- Sexualization of minors
- Extortion
- Fraud
- Animal abuse


#### Moderation
##### Community reports
All registered members of the community can generate reports of content and user accounts. Upon reporting content or accounts, the reporter specifies the alleged offense. Reports then go to a moderation queue where network moderators review the reports and determine both (a) their validity, and (b) the consequences of the violations.


##### Moderators
The network administrator can act as a moderator, and can optionally enable other members of the community to also act as moderators. Moderators have the ability to directly delete content, ban accounts, as well as review a queue of community-generated reports.


##### Minds
Community-generated reports of illegal activity may be reviewed and acted on by Minds staff. If the report is valid, offending user accounts will be banned.`;
