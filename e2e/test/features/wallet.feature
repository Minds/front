# Feature: Wallet

# NOTE: removing for now because onboarding experiments are underway
  # Scenario: Verify Uniqueness modal is visible when clicking 'Join Rewards' button
  #   Given I create a new user
  #   And I close the "m-multifactorauth" modal
  #   And I close the "m-contentsettings" modal
  #   When I navigate via sidebar to the wallet page
  #   And I click the Join Rewards button
  #   Then I see the "[data-ref=in-app-verify-uniqueness-modal]" modal
  #   And I clear my cookies
